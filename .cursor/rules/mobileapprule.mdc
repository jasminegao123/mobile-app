# help me create a wireframe for mobile app with provided document, follow the mobile app's best practice, and reasonable user flow
every time you update code, please keep the globle component like nav bar, the button format , font size, font color and so on, make each screen's style and format and layout consistent, with proper spacing for mobile view, and if i ask you to change one screen or add one screen, please also keep the consistent logic, and only update the screen i mentioned, don't adjust other code

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
