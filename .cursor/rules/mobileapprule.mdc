# help me create a wireframe for the mobile app based on the provided document, follow the best practices for mobile design and ensure a smooth user flow.
when updating code, keep global components (nav bar, button styles, font sizes/colors) consistent, maintain layout and spacing for mobile view, if I ask for changes to a specific screen, only update that screen without altering the rest.

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
